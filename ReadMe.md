${\color{orange}\boxed{DISCLAIMER}}$ This is still a Work in Progress, some behaviors may not be implemented correctly yet.

This is an example project for my [Procedural Dungeon plugin][1].  

Only the version 3.0.0 of the plugin is currently supported by this project.

This is a blueprint-only project but you can turn it as a C++ project if you like to.

You can also change the targeted Unreal Engine version but be careful for versions prior to UE 5.2 as it can break some features used in the project.

## Installation

Download (or clone) this project anywhere you want.\
Install the [Procedural Dungeon plugin][1] either way you like:
- In the engine's `Plugins` folder
- In your newly downloaded project's `Plugins` folder

Then you can launch it by double-clicking the `.uproject` file.

Optionally, you can turn it into a C++ project by creating a C++ class from the editor.
